Remember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger. It's also important to listen to your body and rest when needed. Make sure to warm up properly before each workout and stretch afterwards to prevent injury.

To achieve a lean body, it's also important to focus on your diet. Aim to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Avoid sugary drinks and foods high in saturated and trans fats.

I hope this workout plan helps you achieve your goal of a lean body, User! Remember to stay consistent and patient, as it may take some time to see results.
